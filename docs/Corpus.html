        <p> The texts that I chose for this assignment were War of the Worlds and, War and Peace.
            The reasons I chose these texts was mostly due to thier titles. Both titles contain the
            word War, I thought it would be intesting to do analyasis on both texts to see just how
            similar or different they are based off the theme of war portrayed by thier titles. </p>

            <div class="analysis">
                <p> The first thing that I came to noticed when comparing these two texts was the
                    difference in thier size. Even with just the N-Grams you are able to tell that
                    War and Piece is a much larger text with its higher frequencys of its most
                    common N-Grams. Another thing that I noticed was that the top 4 of each list
                    held the same N-Grams.</p>

            </figure>
            <div class="analysis">
                <p>The next thing I looked at was the first major difference between the two sets of
                    engram results which was the 5th position of War and Peace. This position holds
                    the N-Gram "at the" at position 5 for War of the worlds we see the N-Gram "it
                    was". We do see the N-Gram "at the" in War of The Worlds it is just in the 8th
                    position. I decided to compare the use of them between the two texts. The first
                    major thing that I noticed is that the use of "at the" in War of the Worlds is a
                    little over 100 but its used in War and Peace is over 1000, this goes back to
                    the comparison of the size of the two text files.</p>

            <div class="analysis">
                <p>The next step I took was to do a side by side comparison of the 3-Grams of each
                    text. The first thing I noticed that there werent many similarites, within the
                    top ten we only see 2 phrases that are shared between them but they dont share
                    the same position. Another thing I noticed was that the frequency amount for the
                    3-Grams was much smaller compared to that of the 2-grams</p>

            </figure>
            <div class="analysis">
                <p>Lastly I decided to look into the word war within both texts as it was the main
                    reason I chose these two texts. First I looked in to the concordance view of
                    both texts. Once agian War and Peace trumps the number of results of war of the
                    worlds. Based on what I see the use of war more as a point of referance and the
                    concept of war. in War and Peace is more about the history and interworkings of
                    war while War of the Worlds uses it more as a point of referance and as a
                    general concept. I also added the frequecny graph from Voyant to see the where
                    "war" was used the most throughout each book.</p>
