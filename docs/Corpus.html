        <p>     The texts that I chose for this assignment were War of the Worlds and, War and Peace.
            The reasons I chose these texts was mostly due to thier titles. Both titles contain the
            word War, I thought it would be intesting to do analyasis on both texts to see just how
            similar or different they are based off the theme of war portrayed by thier titles. </p>
