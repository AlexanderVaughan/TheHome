        <p>This is my analysis on the first person narrative adventure called Before Your Eyes. This
            game was developed by GoodbyeWorld Games and published by Skybound Games</p>

        <p>The game Before Your Eyes is a masterpiece of an indie game and an inovation of what
            narrative and adventure games can be. First and formost the most impessive feature of
            this game is its blink interactions. Throught the use of a face cam and eye tracking
            software the game allows you to interact with the game world around you by blinking.
            Throught blinking you decide what interactions to have, what you see in the invironment
            around you, how fast you view something or how slow. The game is determined by what you
            see before your eyes.</p>

                <p> The first thing that I came to noticed when comparing these two texts was the
                    difference in thier size. Even with just the N-Grams you are able to tell that
                    War and Piece is a much larger text with its higher frequencys of its most
                    common N-Grams. Another thing that I noticed was that the top 4 of each list
                    held the same N-Grams.</p>
