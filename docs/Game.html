        <p>The game Before Your Eyes is a masterpiece of an indie game and an inovation of what
            narrative and adventure games can be. First and formost the most impessive feature of
            this game is its blink interactions. Throught the use of a face cam and eye tracking
            software the game allows you to interact with the game world around you by blinking.
            Throught blinking you decide what interactions to have, what you see in the invironment
            around you, how fast you view something or how slow. The game is determined by what you
            see before your eyes.</p>

                    young boy named Benny. Throughout your playthrough of the game you grow up and
                    make decisions through the use of your eyes. You litteraly blink your way
                    throught the life of this boy as he grows up and experiences the world around
                    him. During your journey throughout your life as Benny you will interact with a
                    number of other characters. The main characters you will interact with will be
                    Elle who is your mother, she is a composer and accoutant, when you learn a part
                    of her coposition by ear she will encourage you into to life of a pianist. Then
                    we have Richard your father, while he doesnt play the most active part in your
                    life or at least not as much compared to your mother he is still very supportave
                    of you and cares for you deeply. He is also the person who brings Ernie the cat
                    into your life as well as gives you the camera that leads to you meeting your
                    neighbor Chloe. Next we have Ernie the cat, while there isnt much true
                    interaction with him he serves as a emotional companion and as a maker of time
                    passing as you grow older. Then comes your neighbor Chloe, you meet her while
                    taking photos in your backyard, while she isnt the nicest to you at first you
                    slowly grow closer together and become friends or more depenfing on your
                    decisions. And last but not least are the Ferryman and the Gatekeeper, the

                    lifes story to the Gatekeeper who will judge you and decide if you are worthy to
                    live in thier grand city in the after life.</p>
