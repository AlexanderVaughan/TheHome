        <p>This is my analysis on the first person narrative adventure called Before Your Eyes. This
            game was developed by GoodbyeWorld Games and published by Skybound Games</p>

        <p>My network consists of the main characters, objects and events that occur in the game
            centered around the player character Benny. He is the center as the world is happening
            before his eyes.</p>
        <p>The game Before Your Eyes is a masterpiece of an indie game and an inovation of what
            narrative and adventure games can be. First and formost the most impessive feature of
            this game is its blink interactions. Throught the use of a face cam and eye tracking
            software the game allows you to interact with the game world around you by blinking.
            Throught blinking you decide what interactions to have, what you see in the invironment
            around you, how fast you view something or how slow. The game is determined by what you
            see before your eyes.</p>

                <figcaption>The Main characters that you interact with during your journey, Top Left
                    is the Ferryman, Bottem Left is Richard your father, Middle is Elle your mother,
                    Top Right is Ernie your Cat, and Bottem Right is Chloe your
                    neighbor.</figcaption>

            <div class="analysis">
                <p> In this game you are invited to play from the first person prospective of a
                    young boy named Benny. Throughout your playthrough of the game you grow up and
                    make decisions through the use of your eyes. You litteraly blink your way
                    throught the life of this boy as he grows up and experiences the world around
                    him. During your journey throughout your life as Benny you will interact with a
                    number of other characters. The main characters you will interact with will be
                    Elle who is your mother, she is a composer and accoutant, when you learn a part
                    of her coposition by ear she will encourage you into to life of a pianist. Then
                    we have Richard your father, while he doesnt play the most active part in your
                    life or at least not as much compared to your mother he is still very supportave
                    of you and cares for you deeply. He is also the person who brings Ernie the cat
                    into your life as well as gives you the camera that leads to you meeting your
                    neighbor Chloe. Next we have Ernie the cat, while there isnt much true
                    interaction with him he serves as a emotional companion and as a maker of time
                    passing as you grow older. Then comes your neighbor Chloe, you meet her while
                    taking photos in your backyard, while she isnt the nicest to you at first you
                    slowly grow closer together and become friends or more depenfing on your
                    decisions. And last but not least are the Ferryman and the Gatekeeper, the
                    Ferryman serves as your story teller in the after life, his job is to tell your
                    lifes story to the Gatekeeper who will judge you and decide if you are worthy to
                    live in thier grand city in the after life.</p>

        <h1>Objects</h1>
        <section class="writing">

                <img class="photo" src="images/Objects.PNG" alt="Objects" />
                <figcaption>A few of the main objects the you interact with and help you to progress
                    through the game, Top Left is Artwork, Bottem Left is the Typewritter, Middle is
                    the Cellphone, Top Right is the Camera, Bottem right is the Piano.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <div class="analysis">
                <p> Throught the game you interact with a magnitude of objects not always to
                    completer some sort of objective but to just enhance the overall feeling of the
                    game. You draw and paint and make art as a child and as you grow up and you see
                    developlment as time goes on. You use the typewritter your mother gives you to
                    write your life story while you are sick in bed. The cell phone is used to keep
                    in touvh with your friend Chloe. You use your camera to take pictures of the
                    environment arond you and take the beuty of the world in. You play the piano
                    under your mothers insttruction hoping to make her proud. You arent completeing
                    a task you are simply just living your life with these objects and others.</p>

        <h1>Settings</h1>
        <p>Your life as benny takes place in a variety of setting but a large majority of
            the game takes place in your humble home in your quaint town by the sea. The
            other more major setting that you will find yourself in is the Ferrymans's boat
            and the Gatekeepers tower where your life story is laid our infront of you and
            you are judged on your choices. You also find other settings like the beach
            which is where you first open your eyes to your life story. Thers also the car
            which you ride in with your mother and a few other minor places. </p>
        
        <h1>Visuals and Sound</h1>
        <p> The visuals for this game consist of a very fun and artsy animation style from a
            first person perspective and the visual invironment grows around you from what
            you percieve by blinking. As for the sound there is the ambient sounds of a
            normal life and a sometimes a piano can be heard if you or yourmother are found
            playing it. </p>
        
        <h1>A comment on reality</h1>
        <p> In my opinion this game comments on our reality in two ways. One way is about life and
            the things that go on around us and the other is on the self. On the way it comments on
            life it speaks to the fact that if we move along to fast in life you are bound to miss
            out and miss the meaning in it. As an example while you play the game you progress and
            interact by blinking, when a metranome symbol appears it means the next time you blink
            you will jump forward in time weather its days, months or years, the thing is you cant
            go back. The special thing with the metranome is its going to appear weather the events
            going on around you are done or not. Blink to soon and you might miss a conversation or
            a chance to interact with someone and thers no do over its gone. I think this it true
            about life in a way as well life can fly by in the blink of an eye if we just keep on
            moving through and dont try our best to keep our eyes open and enjoy the moment. The
            second way this comments on reality is on the self. I belive this is also portrayed by
            my Kumu network. You are the main character in you life. In my network the largest piece
            with the most connections is Benny. You are the one who chooses who it is you interact
            with, you make your own choices your own connections your life is yours you decide what
            happens with it. While some of the other pieces are play a large part in your life they
            pale incomparison in how important you are to your own life. That is what I believe this
            game has to comment on. </p>
