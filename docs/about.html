        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <h3>GITHUB and HTML</h3>
        <p> This is my comparative reflection of both sites I created during this project. During
            this project I learned how to use GitHub and HTML coding to create a website. As a new
            learner of these systems I think the most difficult part was learning the code and all
            the different coding blocks as well as figuring out how to apply my CSS styling to my
            code. Some advantages I would say that the GitHub coding has is you have a lot more
            control over every aspect of your design and website. You aren’t working with to much
            prefabricated material and you pretty much are on your own to decide how it looks, along
            with image sizing and placement, fonts and colors and overall organization of the
            project. With GitHub while you have a lot of freedom to modify the layout and
            organization it is also very tedious going back and forth writing new lines of code and
            trying to fond the best looking method for your idea. The skills that are really
            required to do something like this with GitHub is listening to the instructions and
            being able to learn by example and be resourceful with example code. If I want to
            improve this website I think I would like to learn to do more with my CSS and HTML code
            in general. </p>
        <h3>WordPress</h3>
        <p> The only challenge that came with WordPress for me was navigation, finding out where the
            different tools I needed was a bit of a pain but not horrible. As for advantages, I feel
            as though its a lot more user friendly in the way you create edit and update pages. Its
            all on one program and there is no switching between three different applications just
            to see if your jpeg uploaded correctly. A challenge that comes with layout and
            organization is you are seemingly stuck to presets and very cookie cut methods of page
            orientation. The only real skills you need for this is, typing and a willingness to
            navigate a bit. I think I’d like to learn more about what I can do with this website
            design wise to help improve it. </p>
